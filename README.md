# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game built in Python. It allows two players to take turns playing as "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after each move and displays the current board state. It ends when one player wins or the board is full, with the result announced at the end.
